# Grass-detection (ML)
## Evaluation of the projective cover of herbaceous vegetation using convolutional neural networks (CNN)
Task - Determine the percentage of projective cover of grass vegetation in a photograph using ML. [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timofeymoiseev/grass)
The process of describing of the grass grows conditions has played important role in environmental research. During that time in the natural science had developed a methodology of forests, grasslands, savannahs, urbanized areas assessment. Evaluation of the projective cover of herbaceous vegetation is one of the indicators of the state of ecosystems of pastures, lawns, parks. It is also used in forest rehabilitation strategies or for assessment of trends and status of the agricultural ecosystem.
## Study area
The study area was located within the northwestern Moscow on border with Moscow region. The native flora is high antropogenically transformed and composed by secondary forest (e.g. Tilia cordata, Betula pendula, Picea abies et al.) with diverse herbaceous layer. Moreover, materials for training and testing were collected within park areas. Field survey were conducted from July to August in 2022.
## Data collection
Dataset represented by different plant species, including lawns. This was done to include as many different leaf shapes (lanceolate, linear, etc.) as possible in the dataset to improve the model.
The place for photographing was chosen based on the following thesis:
- Images contain various plant communities most typical of a biome;
- The images included dead plant and soil surface.
Every image was made from a square area at a height of 1 m from the surface using an IPhone 11 camera with resolution of 4032 x 3024 pixels.
